By strengthening the role of universities in addressing these challenges, I aim to contribute to Uzbekistan’s transition from a lower-middle-income country (LMIC) to a well-developed economy.
One of the key priorities is ensuring quality education (SDG 4). This involves integrating sustainability principles into the university curriculum, particularly in finance, economics, and business education. By adopting innovative teaching methods such as case studies, project-based learning, and digital tools, students can develop critical thinking and practical problem-solving skills that are essential for sustainable economic development. Additionally, fostering strong partnerships with industry leaders, policymakers, and international institutions will help align education with real-world economic needs, ensuring that graduates are well-prepared for the evolving job market.
Another crucial area of focus is reducing poverty (SDG 1) through education and skills development. Expanding access to higher education for underprivileged students via scholarships and financial aid will ensure that talented individuals, regardless of their background, can contribute to the country’s economic growth. Moreover, integrating entrepreneurship and financial literacy programs into university curricula will empower students to create businesses, generate employment, and contribute to economic resilience. Universities can also serve as centers for social innovation, where students and researchers collaborate on solutions to reduce economic inequality and enhance social mobility.
Lastly, higher education must play a pivotal role in driving economic growth (SDG 8). By aligning academic programs with the needs of high-value industries, universities can help bridge the skills gap and prepare students for careers in emerging fields such as technology, finance, and sustainable manufacturing. Strengthening research capabilities and providing policy recommendations on sustainable finance, investment strategies, and green industries will further support Uzbekistan’s transition to a high-income economy. Additionally, fostering international collaborations will enable the adoption of best practices from well-developed economies, helping Uzbekistan create a knowledge-based, sustainable growth model.
By focusing on these key areas, I hope to contribute to the transformation of higher education into a powerful driver of sustainable development, ensuring that quality education not only reduces poverty but also accelerates economic growth and strengthens Uzbekistan’s position in the global economy.",Yes,"Tashkent State University of Economics (TSUE) represents a large higher education community with approximately 60,000 students and around 3,000 academic and non-academic staff.

UoL fosters a collaborative and dynamic research ecosystem through its five specialized research centers: the UoL Research Center, the Executive Education Center, the CIIM Bioeconomia Center, the UoL Centre for ESG, and the UoL Centre for DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion).
Some indicative actions that the university implements to support the promotion and awareness raising of sustainable development are the following:
The Ethics, Responsibility, and Sustainability academic course which is compulsory for all students and focuses on injecting ethical principles and core values into the conduct, decision making and problem solving of current and future managers and leaders. This program supports students to learn how to resolve ethical dilemmas, to create shared business and social value through CSR and to enhance the sustainability of their operations and strategy.
The CIIM Bioeconomia Center of the UoL, with many years of action and studies, on the issues of Local Government, organizes a series of Special Educational Programs on a regular basis, with the aim of strengthening the knowledge and abilities of Municipal and Community Councillors. With topics such as ‘Green Consumption’, ‘Cultural Sustainability’ and ‘Green Cultural Entrepreneurship’, the Center supports their journey for enduring growth within the realm of sustainable development.
The most recent implementation was in the context of the candidacy of the Municipality of Kourion for the title of European Capital of Culture 2030 (Website: KOURION2030) through which a series of interactive workshops and seminars were implemented focusing on the promotion of Cultural Sustainability and Sustainable Consumption. These workshops introduced to participants the European Green Deal and the notions of ‘Cultural Sustainability’ and ‘Green Cultural Entrepreneurship’. In an effort to design an inclusive and sustainable cultural strategy for the Municipality of Kourion, an analysis and the value of the 17SDGs in relation to culture was also presented.
Also, aspart of its Corporate Social Responsibility, the Center actively informs local authorities through on-site meetings and/or free educational seminars about their obligations leading up to 2030. This ensures that they align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the European Protocol for Green Municipalities and Communities. Additionally, it engages with businesses and through presentations and webinars informs them about the value of green economy.
On another note, several research projects are in the process of implementation which focus on proposing solutions and actions for sustainable development both at local and European levels. For instance the InterGenic project aims to promote the twin (green and digital) EU Transition through intergenerational learning and by developing an intergenerational action in each participating country (Spain, Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Austria, Ireland and Belgium), focusing on the development of sustainable and digitally informed local communities. 
The implementation process of such projects on behalf of the university is coordinated by the UoL Research Center and in several cases in collaboration with the university’s departments, such as the Psychology, Education and Innovation and Technology.

At the Global Student Forum (GSF), we view higher education as a cornerstone for achieving sustainable development. Our work in this area focuses on the following key priorities:

Promoting the Right to Higher Education as a Public Good
We advocate for accessible, inclusive, and publicly funded higher education systems that serve the common good, not private profit. This includes resisting the commodification and privatisation of education, and ensuring that no student is left behind due to financial or structural barriers.

Embedding Sustainable Development Across Curricula and Governance
GSF calls for a holistic integration of sustainability in higher education—embedding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in both academic curricula and institutional governance. We push for interdisciplinary learning and transformative pedagogy that equips students to address global challenges.

Advancing Green Skills for the Just Transition
We promote the development of green skills within higher education systems to empower students to actively participate in the just transition to sustainable economies. This includes technical, cognitive, and social skills needed for climate resilience, green innovation, and sustainability-driven employment.

Student-Led Action for Sustainability
We support and amplify student-led initiatives advancing climate justice, social equity, and sustainability on campuses and beyond. GSF works to strengthen student participation in decision-making processes related to sustainability policies at local, national, and global levels.

Global Solidarity and Partnerships
Through international collaboration, we foster solidarity among student unions and movements to share best practices and campaign for higher education systems that contribute to just, peaceful, and sustainable societies.

“Biodiversity Conservation” is my main focus, as in point 15 of the SDGs, to maintain and protect both habitats and species. This is supported by the variety of experiences I have, such as an internship at the Ministry of Forestry Republic Indonesia in the directorate of species and genetic conservation and research on proboscis monkeys and Javan leopards as well as several studies related to sustainable management of the environment and natural resources.
In the research activities that I participated in, it also based its activities on the three pillars of service, research, and teaching. This aims to increase awareness and movement through cross-sectors and various approaches, and research activities will underlie other follow-up actions for the sustainability of the ecosystem. then supported by the courses I took in lectures such as, Climate Change Law, Sustainable Development, Environmental Law, International Environmental Law, Natural Resources Law, and other supporting theories of sustainable development.",Yes,"As a law student with a specialization in environmental, spatial, and agrarian law, I have developed strong competencies and academic depth in these areas while also maintaining a solid understanding of broader legal foundations. My primary focus is on biodiversity conservation, which aligns with Goal 15 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, and halting biodiversity loss.  This focus is not only academic but also practical, as demonstrated by a range of hands-on experiences. I completed an internship at the Ministry of Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia, specifically within the Directorate of Species and Genetic Conservation, where I was actively involved in the formulation and evaluation of species protection strategies. In addition, I have contributed to research involving endemic and endangered species, including studies on proboscis monkeys in Kalimantan and Javan leopards in West Java, which deepened my understanding of species conservation challenges and habitat protection strategies.  I also took part in research-based activities in the Gunung Sawal Nature Reserve in West Java and a conservation area in South Kalimantan, where I engaged with field data collection and interdisciplinary analysis. These experiences allowed me to apply legal knowledge in real-world conservation efforts and policy reviews, strengthening my capacity to support ecosystem sustainability through law and advocacy.  My research activities are grounded in the three pillars of service, research, and teaching, designed to promote awareness and action across sectors through multidimensional approaches. These activities not only aim to generate knowledge but also to initiate concrete steps toward long-term ecological sustainability.  This academic and practical focus is further reinforced by a series of specialized courses I have undertaken, including Climate Change Law, Sustainable Development, Environmental Law, International Environmental Law, and Natural Resources Law. These have equipped me with a comprehensive legal framework and analytical tools to address environmental and conservation challenges.  While I am part of a relatively small but highly focused academic and professional network—consisting of students, researchers, and legal practitioners—we are united by a shared commitment to biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource management.

The SDGs are a set of 17 goals approved by the 193 member states of the UN which aim to transform the world by 2030. The 2024 Impact Rankings is the sixth edition and comprised 2,152 universities from 125 countries and regions.

King's Food initiatives aim to reduce food waste generated on campus, for which they received a Public Sector Catering Award in April 2024. Examples include a 50@50 scheme that sells food that is about to go out of date at a 50% discount 50 minutes before closing; food is placed on the Too Good To Go app to ensure it is not wasted at the end of the day; and a Love Your Leftovers campaign.

1. Mindset Shift -If we want to achieve SDG ,then first we need to shift from self-centric mindset towards an eco-centric one and without this shift it's a risk of green washing.

2.Eco Action- We need to take eco-conscious action ,just by learning things we can't create impact.

3.Green Skill Set - We need to focus on developing Green skill set among the students so that they can step into the Green economy.

Finally we would like to say sustainability is not a one time investment in learning courses or getting degree or certificate, it's a life long journey of eco-conscious living to create green peaceful world  for all the creature of nature.🌍

In 2003, AIT collaborated with the Thai Government’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to create the Queen Sirikit Arboretum and Botanical Garden. Climate change, our paramount challenge, led to global commitments like the Paris Agreement, COP26, and COP27.

AIT’s responded to the immediate need by committing to foster an all-encompassing botanical garden campus, combating both climate change and biodiversity loss. AIT envisions achieving Net Zero status by 2030, with reference to an institute-wide campus plan concept note endorsed by the AIT Executive Committee on 19 Dec 2022 and by the Board of Trustees of AIT, highlighting its commitment to sustainability. By integrating the project with its earlier campus plans, AIT takes a significant step forward with a  pledge toward 100% renewable energy and exemplifying how institutions can proactively contribute to a healthier planet.

AIT Sustainability Policy Statement
As per the AA-1-2-9 “AIT Sustainability Policy”, published on 8 Dec 2021
AIT’s vision and definition of sustainability encompasses fostering a transition towards sustainability while reflecting a balance of economic, environmental, and socially responsible values through education, knowledge generation, translating knowledge into practice, and practicing those sustainability ideals in its day-to-day and strategic operations.

Therefore, AIT’s goals are to become a living laboratory of low carbon, resource recycling, 100% renewable energy powered, green, and environmentally friendly educational hub and practice them.

ESDGoals LLC,www.esdgoals.com ,Elmir Mammadli,Director,elmir.mammadli@esdgoals.com,Azerbaijan,Company,"Our Areas of Focus in Higher Education for Sustainable Development

At ESDGoals, we actively collaborate with universities and higher education institutions through formal Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) to support the integration of sustainable development principles into academic and institutional structures. Our work aligns closely with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the global Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) agenda.

Our main areas of focus include:

Strategic Support and ESG Integration
We assist higher education institutions in developing and implementing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies. This includes aligning university operations, governance, and curriculum with national ESG standards and international sustainability frameworks such as the GRI Standards, CSRD, and SDG-based performance indicators.

Curriculum Development and Capacity Building
We provide technical support for integrating sustainability and climate change-related topics into academic curricula. This includes designing training modules, co-developing courses, and organizing seminars/webinars on green economy, ESG reporting, climate resilience, and sustainable innovation.

Research and Policy Collaboration
Through joint research projects and academic engagement, we promote evidence-based policymaking and practical research on green transformation, sustainable business, and circular economy models. We also contribute to developing national frameworks by mobilizing academic expertise.

Student and Faculty Engagement
We support youth leadership and faculty development through workshops, innovation challenges, and career planning sessions focused on sustainability-oriented professions.

Supporting Institutional Transformation
ESDGoals acts as a strategic partner to help universities become models of sustainability—enhancing their procurement policies, operational sustainability, and stakeholder engagement mechanisms in line with green transition goals.

By bridging the gap between academic institutions and national ESG efforts, we aim to create long-term systemic change and nurture a generation of professionals equipped to lead sustainable transformation across sectors.
